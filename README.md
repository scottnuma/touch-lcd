# Easy Cereal
## A Python Implementation of ezLCD-3xx serial communication

The [ezLCD-3xx family](https://earthlcd.com/product-category/ezlcd-intelligent-lcds/) is a series of LCD monitors that use serial communication over USB. The ezLCD-3xx family by default can be controlled through its [own language](https://earthlcd.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ezLCD-3xx-EDK-Sept-User-Manual.pdf) based upon BASIC. Easy Cereal seeks to make using the ezLCD-3xx family easier to use through Python control. Easy Cereal also ships with a number of use examples. Quick Start provides the foundation for interfacing with the Google Calendar API. Daily Display shows the user's calendar and the current weather conditions on an ezLCD-3xx screen.
